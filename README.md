# Now Exxyll is Improved More

Now, I'm working and actively developing at [gifaldyazkaa/exxyll-rewrite-v13](https://github.com/gifaldyazka/exxyll-rewrite-v13). We're working and trying to upgrading to Exxyll v2 that Uses Discord.js v13. So, This Repository may be archived and read only soon.

# Run the Bot

You can start the bot with some commands. Here is it!

- `yarn start` to start the bot. Run `yarn shard` instead if your bot at 2000+ Servers.
- `yarn run dev` to start development mode using `nodemon`.
- `yarn lint` to lint using ESLint.
- `yarn shard` to sharding the bot. Only run this if your bot at 2000+ Servers.
