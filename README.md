### Must Fix

- [ ] Fix Custom Emoji Load Error
      Because the nitro at our server is dead, So, we just can using 66 emojis from 100 emojis +.
      And this must be fixed for better User-Experience. Thats'it. You must fix it before released publicly.

### Idea

- [ ] Add Cooldown Features to limit Interaction. (Due unknown interaction (as known interaction limitation)).
